  Splunk Data Onboarding App
</h1>

This Splunk app simplifies the data onboarding process, especially for non-technical users. It allows users to fetch data from APIs and store it into Splunk KV Stores, with an intuitive UI to preview, pre-process, and manage inputs.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 🔌 Easily onboard data from APIs via a simple form.
- 👀 Preview the structure of your data before storing it.
- 🧹 Apply pre-processing (e.g., exclude unwanted JSON paths).
- 💾 Store the resulting data in Splunk KV Stores.
- 🚀 Designed to be extensible — future support for more input types planned.

```bash
./scripts/package.sh
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** This script must be executed from the root of the project

#### 📁 What It Does

- Bundles the app into a `.tar.gz` file so you can then upload the `.tar.gz` file to your Splunk instance via:

        Apps > Manage Apps > Install app from file**

## 🛠️ Installation

The app package is located here [api_input_connect.tar.gz](api_input_connect.tar.gz)

### 🐳 Development with Docker

For local development, use the provided Docker setup script to run Splunk Enterprise in a container with the app mounted:

```bash
./scripts/setup-docker-dev.sh
```

This script creates a Splunk container with the app automatically mounted. Once running, access Splunk Web at `http://localhost:8000` (default credentials: `admin` / `changeme!`).

## 🔄 Roadmap

The current MVP supports JSON data from API sources, filtered via simple exclusion logic.

Planned features include:

- 🧪 Advanced data pre-processing (e.g., renaming, transformation)
- 🧩 Push data directly to indexes or other output types
- 🔌 Convert script to a modular input to be Splunk Cloud friendly
